# Terminal AI 🚀

> Your Terminal-Based Conversational AI Agent for Full-Stack Project Creation and GitHub Deployment.

---

## 📚 Overview

**Terminal AI** is a terminal-based, prompt-driven AI agent that helps you **create full-stack projects** and **deploy them to GitHub**, all from simple commands — without writing manual shell commands.

- Create a React app, a Node.js backend, a full MERN stack — just by typing it!
- Automatically push the project to GitHub.
- Save hours of project setup time.

All you need is your **terminal** and **your ideas**.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Autonomous Project Creation**: Create full-stack project folders, files, and starter code.
- **Conversational CLI**: Talk to your terminal with prompts like "Create a React app".
- **GitHub Integration**: Auto-create remote repos and push your project.
- **Live Updates**: Always know what task is happening behind the scenes.
- **Full-Stack Capabilities**: Supports both frontend and backend scaffolding.

## 🌍 Why Terminal AI?

As a college student or beginner developer:
- Stop wasting time on repetitive setup tasks.
- Avoid mistakes when initializing projects.
- Quickly prototype ideas, projects, or hackathon submissions.
- Focus on writing **meaningful code**, not boilerplate.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Run the AI agent**:
   ```bash
   python chat.py
   ```

2. **Give a prompt**:
   ```plaintext
   create a react todo list app
   ```

   ➡️ Terminal AI will:
   - Create a folder `react-todo/`
   - Scaffold a full React project inside it.
   - Write boilerplate code for you.

3. **Give a second prompt**:
   ```plaintext
   push this project to github
   ```

   ➡️ Terminal AI will:
   - Initialize Git locally.
   - Create a new remote GitHub repository.
   - Push your code automatically.

4. **Done!** 🚀
